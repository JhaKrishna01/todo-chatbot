# To-Do List & Chatbot Web App

This project is a minimal yet extensible web application that combines a classic to-do list manager with a conversational chatbot interface. Designed for both beginners and those looking to expand their web development skills, this app demonstrates how to integrate a rule-based chatbot with a practical productivity tool using modern web technologies.

## Overview

The application allows users to manage their daily tasks through a simple, intuitive web interface. On the left side of the page, users can add, view, and delete to-do items. On the right, a chatbot is available to interact with users in natural language, providing a more engaging way to manage tasks. The chatbot can respond to greetings, help users add or remove tasks, and list current to-dos, making the experience more interactive and user-friendly.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python with Flask, providing RESTful API endpoints for both the to-do list and chatbot functionalities.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for a clean, responsive user interface.
- **Chatbot:** Rule-based logic, easily upgradable to use AI APIs (like OpenAI) for more advanced conversational abilities.

## Features

- Add, view, and delete to-do items with instant feedback.
- Chatbot interface for managing tasks via chat commands (e.g., “add Buy milk”, “remove Buy milk”, “list”).
- Responsive and clean UI, suitable for both desktop and mobile browsers.
- Simple project structure, making it easy to understand and extend.
- No database required for the minimal version—tasks are stored in memory (can be upgraded to persistent storage).

## Getting Started

This project is ideal for those learning Flask, web development, or chatbot integration. It serves as a foundation for more advanced features, such as user authentication, persistent storage, or AI-powered chat.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run the Flask app and open the web interface in your browser.
3. Manage your to-dos directly or interact with the chatbot for a conversational experience.
